On my third attempt with rickshaw.js I added my own custom x-axis. The graph Renders two data points one 
being revenue and the other being media cost. Additionally the x-axis has been rotated -45% so the labels 
donâ€™t over lap each other using d3. Additionally the header updates the date so the title can reflect that it 
is the most current data.
